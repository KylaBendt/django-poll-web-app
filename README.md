# A Django based poll site

This is a simple web app based on the tutorial for Django.  Users can vote on a question and then see running totals for vote counts.  

I have added some additional features like categories for questions in order to make sure that I am actually learning the material. 

Includes a full admin panel to manage categories, questions and choices.
